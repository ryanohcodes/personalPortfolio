## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Just a simple landing page utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form at the bottom of the page uses php to send an e-mail directly to me. 


## Optimizations

Php for e-mails are not supported on the hosting site. I am using a 3rd party application to automate the e-mail sending. It would certainly be more efficient if I exluded it to due the large amount of data that is being collected and sent. 


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that hosting sites have their own set of rules and operating procedures. Rather than just blinding working on a solution, it would behoove me to read documentation first.
